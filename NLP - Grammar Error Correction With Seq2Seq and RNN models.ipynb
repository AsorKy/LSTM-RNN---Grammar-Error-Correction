This problem is commonly encountered in tasks such as machine translation, summarization, text generation, Grammar Error Correction (GEC) and more. \n\n**Why Encoder-Decoder Models are Useful:**\n\nEncoder-Decoder models are well-suited for the Seq2Seq problem because they provide an effective framework for handling input and output sequences of varying lengths. The key components of the Encoder-Decoder architecture are:\n\n**1)-Encoder:** The Encoder takes the input sequence and compresses it into a fixed-size context vector, also known as the \"thought vector\" or \"latent representation.\" This context vector aims to capture the essential information from the input sequence and serves as the foundation for generating the output.\n\n**2)-Decoder:** The Decoder takes the context vector produced by the Encoder and generates the output sequence one element at a time. It uses the context vector and the previously generated elements of the output sequence (during training) to conditionally generate the next element in the sequence.\n\nUsing an Encoder-Decoder architecture allows the model to handle variable-length input and output sequences in a way that traditional models like bag-of-words or fixed-size input models cannot.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Carrying out the Problem with RNN, LSTM, and LSTM Seq2Seq:**\n\n**1)-RNN(Recurrent Neural Network):**\n* RNNs can be used for Seq2Seq problems by feeding the input sequence step-by-step into the RNN cell and using the final hidden state as the context vector.\n* *Limitation:* RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it difficult for them to capture long-range dependencies in sequences, leading to difficulties in handling long sequences.\n\n**2)-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**\n* LSTMs are a variant of RNNs that mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by using memory cells and gating mechanisms.\n* LSTMs can better capture long-term dependencies, making them more effective for Seq2Seq problems compared to simple RNNs.\n\n**3)-LSTM Seq2Seq:**\n* An LSTM-based Seq2Seq model combines two blocks of LSTM networks as both the Encoder and Decoder.\n* The Encoder LSTM processes the input sequence, and the final hidden state becomes the context vector.\n* The Decoder LSTM generates the output sequence by taking the context vector as input and predicting each element of the output sequence step-by-step.\n* *Limitation:* While LSTM Seq2Seq models are an improvement over simple RNNs, they may encounter difficulties with extremely long sequences due to the limitations of LSTMs.\n\nEncoder-Decoder models provide an elegant solution to Seq2Seq problems, enabling the handling of variable-length input and output sequences. RNNs and LSTMs are foundational components for these models, with LSTMs being preferred due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, even LSTM-based Seq2Seq models have limitations in handling very long sequences, and for extremely challenging cases, more advanced architectures like Transformer-based models have been introduced to overcome these limitations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.2- Utilities <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1-bullet\"></a> ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def correct_sentence(model, sentence, inp_vocabulary, out_vocabulary, device, max_length=50):\n    # Ensure the sentence is a string and convert tokens to lowercase\n    if not isinstance(sentence, str):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input sentence must be a string\")\n    sentence = sentence.lower()\n\n    # Load tokenizer for English text\n    tokenizer_eng = get_tokenizer('basic_english')\n\n    # Tokenize English sentence\n    tokens = tokenizer_eng(sentence)\n\n    # Add <SOS> and <EOS> tokens in the beginning and end, respectively\n    tokens.insert(0, inp_vocabulary.init_token)\n    tokens.append(inp_vocabulary.eos_token)\n\n    # Convert tokens to indices\n    text_to_indices = [inp_vocabulary.vocab.stoi[token] for token in tokens]\n\n    # Convert to Tensor\n    sentence_tensor = torch.LongTensor(text_to_indices).unsqueeze(1).to(device)\n\n    # Build encoder hidden, cell state\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        hidden, cell = model.encoder(sentence_tensor)\n\n    outputs = [out_vocabulary.vocab.stoi[\"<sos>\"]]\n\n    for _ in range(max_length):\n        previous_word = torch.LongTensor([outputs[-1]]).to(device)\n\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            output, hidden, cell = model.decoder(previous_word, hidden, cell)\n            best_guess = output.argmax(1).item()\n\n        outputs.append(best_guess)\n\n        # Model predicts it's the end of the sentence\n        if output.argmax(1).item() == out_vocabulary.vocab.stoi[\"<eos>\"]:\n            break\n\n    translated_sentence = [out_vocabulary.vocab.itos[idx] for idx in outputs]\n\n    # Remove start token\n    return translated_sentence[1:]\n\n    \n    ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-28T04:00:57.796962Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-28T04:00:57.797354Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-28T04:00:57.810049Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-28T04:00:57.797320Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-28T04:00:57.808875Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def bleu(data, model, input_text, corr_text, device):\n    targets = []\n    outputs = []\n    \n    for example in data:\n        src = vars(example)[\"src\"]\n        trg = vars(example)[\"trg\"]\n        \n        prediction = correct_sentence(model, src, input_text, corr_text, device)\n        prediction = prediction[:1] # remove <eos> token\n        \n        targets.append([trg])\n        outputs.append(prediction)\n    \n    return bleu_score(outputs, targets)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-28T04:00:58.703745Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-28T04:00:58.704131Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-28T04:00:58.711659Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-28T04:00:58.704101Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-28T04:00:58.710284Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def save_checkpoint(state, filename=\"my_checkpoint.pth.tar\"):\n    print(\"=> Saving checkpoint\")\n    torch.save(state, filename)\n    \ndef load_checkpoint(checkpoint, model, optimizer):\n    print(\"=> Loading checkpoint\")\n    model.load_state_dict(checkpoint[\"state_dict\"])\n    optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint[\"optimizer\"])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-28T04:00:59.687157Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-28T04:00:59.688395Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-28T04:00:59.695100Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-28T04:00:59.688342Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-28T04:00:59.693611Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2)-Data Preprocessing <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1-bullet\"></a> \n","metadata":{"id":"YBC0fkFEklIQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.1-Data importing <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1-bullet\"></a> ","metadata":{"id":"oYfmPht7qZgQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The basic idea is to train the model to take a sentence with grammar errors as input and generate the corrected sentence as the output. However, there are some key considerations to keep in mind when adapting the model for this new task:\n1. The dataset must consists of pairs of sentences where one sentece contains grammar error, and the other sentence, is the same sentence with the errors corrected.\n2. Tokenization and Vocabulary: Ensure that both the input and output sentences are properly tokenized and that you build separate vocabularies for the input and output languages (in this case, the original sentence with errors and the corrected sentence).\n3. Loss Function: Consider using a loss function that is tailored for sequence generation tasks, such as the CrossEntropyLoss, but it should be designed to handle variable- lenght sequences.\n4. Data Augmentation: In grammar error correction, you might not have a huge amount of labeled data. Data augmentation techniques like adding synthetic errors to the correct sentences can help improve the model's generalization and performance.\n5. Preprocessing: Depending on the complexity of the grammar errors you are dealing with, you might need to perform additional preprocessing steps to handle specific error patterns. For example, if you're dealing with spelling mistakes, you might need to use techniques like lemmatization or stemming to handle word variations.\n6. Encoder-Decoder Architecture is the best option to carry sequence to sequence tasks.\n7. Post-processing: After the Seq2Seq model generates the corrected sentence, you might need to perform some post-processing to ensure that the output is in a grammatically correct and coherent form. This can include tasks like capitalization, punctuation, and word order adjustments.\n8. Evaluation: You will need to establish appropriate evaluation metrics for grammar error correction, such as precision, recall, F1 score, or BLEU score, depending on your specific requirements.\n9. Fine-tuning and Regularization: Fine-tuning the pre-trained Seq2Seq model on the grammar error correction task might yield better results. Additionally, regularization techniques like dropout can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we are going to use two standard datasets for grammatical error detection:\n\n*   Lang-8\n\n","metadata":{"id":"S-lGuWfVqeEl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Lang-8 <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1-bullet\"></a> ","metadata":{"id":"add1r7WZuuLT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lang-8 loading and extraction of correct and incorrect sentences\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n#path = \"/kaggle/working/Lang8_entries.train\"\npath = \"/kaggle/input/entriestrain/entries.train\"\n\nf1 = open(path)\nlines1 = f1.readlines()\ninp1 = [] # list for incorrect sentences\ntgt1 = [] # storing\n\nfor i in lines1:\n    lst = i.split(\"\\t\")\n\n# IF LENGTH OF THE LIST IS GREATER THAN 5 THEN CORRECT SENTTENCE EXISTS OTHERWISE ONLY INCORRECT SENTENCE IS PRESENT\n    if len(lst)>5  :     #IF LENGTH IS GREATER THAN 5\n        inp1.append(lst[-2]) # APPEND SECONG LAST ITEM IN LIST WHICH IS INCORRECT SENTENCE\n        tgt1.append(lst[-1]) # APPEND LAST ITEM IN THE LIST WHICH IS","metadata":{"id":"InCGif21rLUn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690152493547,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1904,"user":{"displayName":"Nicolas Castillo Ojeda","userId":"07071882850745015721"}},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-28T04:01:03.876314Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-28T04:01:03.876722Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-28T04:01:07.034912Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-28T04:01:03.876686Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-28T04:01:07.033790Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/kaggle/input/entriestrain/entries.train\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.DataFrame()\ndf['y'] = list('1'*len(inp1))\ndf['input'] = inp1\ndf['output'] = tgt1","metadata":{"id":"R2LzGW4nttTM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690152493830,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":286,"user":{"displayName":"Nicolas Castillo Ojeda","userId":"07071882850745015721"}},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-28T04:02:58.134111Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-28T04:02:58.134523Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-28T04:02:58.368105Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-28T04:02:58.134489Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-28T04:02:58.366991Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","metadata":{"id":"Jgy7GGpqujEr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690152493831,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Nicolas Castillo Ojeda","userId":"07071882850745015721"}},"outputId":"1f1d2453-c13a-4f33-9a2f-fc1f0e6c7a17","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-28T04:01:09.963962Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-28T04:01:09.964333Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-28T04:01:10.040111Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-28T04:01:09.964302Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-28T04:01:10.038754Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"execution_count":10,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   y                                              input  \\\n0  1   And he took in my favorite subject like soccer .   \n1  1  Actually , who let me know about Lang - 8 was ...   \n2  1      His Kanji 's ability is much better than me .   \n3  1  We 've known each other for only half a year ,...   \n4  1  I heard a sentence last night when I watched TV .   \n\n                                              output  \n0  And he took in my favorite subjects like socce...  \n1  Actually , he was the one who let me know abou...  \n2     His Kanji ability is much better than mine .\\n  \n3  We 've known each other for only half a year ,...  \n4  I heard a sentence last night when I was watch...

In a Seq2Seq model, the decoder processes one token at a time during inference, generating the output sequence word by word. However, in practice, we still need to handle batch processing for efficiency. To make if compatible with the LSTM, which expects a 3-dimensional input with dimensions (batch_size, seq_lenght, input_size), the ``x`` tensor with shape ``(N)`` (where ``N`` is the batch size) needs to be reshaped to ``(1,N)`` to represent a single word token. The additional dimension of 1 indicates that the input word is a sequence of lenght 1.\n\nOn the other hand, the ``predictions`` tensor represents the output probabilities for each word in the ``target`` vocabulary. Its shape is ``(1, N, tk_out_size)`` where ``1`` is the sequence lenght (we predict one word at a time), ``N`` is the batch size, and  \"tk_out_lenght\" is the lenght of the target vocabulary.\n\nHowever, for calculating the loss function during training, we need to compare the predictions with the actual targets. The loss function generally expects the predictions to have the shale ``(N, tk_out_size)`` to compare them with the target tensor of the same shape. To achive this, the DecoderSS2S class remove the first dimension of the  \"predictions\" tensor using  ``squeeze(0)``.

Teacher forcing is a technique commonly used in sequence-to-sequence models to stabilize and speed up the training.\n\nWhen ``teacher_force_ratio`` is set to ``1.0``, the model uses teacher forcing for all time steps during trainign. Teacher forcing means that the decoder is feed with the actual ground truth  target words at each time step, rather than using its own predictions as input. This helps the model to learn more quicky and effectivelly, especially when the predicted outputs may be incorrect during early stages of training. On the other hand, when ``teacher_force_ratio`` is set to ``0.0`` the model does not use teacher forching at all, then, the decoder´s predictions from the previous timestep are used as input to the decoder at the current time step.
